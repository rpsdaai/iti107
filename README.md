# iti107
For this assignment, you are expected to identify what class of objects you would like to detect and train a custom detector for the identified objects. At least one of the object class you choose
SHOULD NOT be from existing COCO object class (refers to https://github.com/amikelive/coco-labels/blob/master/coco-labels-2014_2017.txt for the list)

The following are the tasks you will need to complete:
1. Collect and annotate the images
2. Decide on ONE pretrained model you would like to use
3. Define the training pipeline in TensorFlow Object Detection (TFOD) API
4. Train the model and evaluate the model performance
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance
6. Export your best model for inference
7. Use your exported model for inference model on a selected test image and selected test video (around 1 minute)
